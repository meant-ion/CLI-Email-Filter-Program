# CLI-Email-Filter-Program

This was a project for my Data Structures course, where the focus was on vectors. 

The main idea is that this program will do 4 things:
  1. load a spamlist from a file
  2. display the contents of the file to the screen
  3. check an email address to see if it pops up in the spamlist, and tells the user what it found
  4. loads a list of emails, pushes them through a filter, and outputs the non-spam emails to file
  
I can guarantee that this program is not anything that would work under a normal setting/email processing software
