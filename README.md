# CLI-Email-Filter-Program

This was a project for my Data Structures course, where the focus was on vectors. 

The main idea is that this program will do 4 things:
  1. load a spamlist from a file
  2. display the contents of the file to the screen
  3. check an email address to see if it pops up in the spamlist, and tells the user what it found
  4. loads a list of emails, pushes them through a filter, and outputs the non-spam emails to file
  
I can guarantee that this program is not anything that would work under a normal setting/email processing software.

We were required to use a library the professor had created, labeled 'ourvector.h', which prints out how many accesses and other interesting data after the program is ended by the user. The other text files are the files that were used to test the functions, and the larger ones were used to measure the efficiency of the binary search algorithm and confirm it was within bounds.
